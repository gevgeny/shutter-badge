## Example Use Case

### Add to Your Dashboard

1. Open your Home Assistant dashboard in **Edit Mode**.
2. Add a manual card with the YAML configuration above.
3. Save and enjoy controlling your shutters directly from the badge.

---

## Notes

- Ensure that the `switch_up` and `switch_down` entities are configured and functional in your Home Assistant instance.
- The `duration` option ensures that the switches automatically turn off after the specified time to prevent hardware damage.
- Customize the badge label, icon, and color to match your dashboard theme.

---

## Troubleshooting

If the badge does not work as expected:

1. Confirm that the resource URL has been added correctly in **Dashboard Settings > Resources**.
2. Verify that the `switch_up` and `switch_down` entities are valid and accessible.
3. Check the browser's developer console for any errors.
